    "When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to inherit from the base `Exception` class. The `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python, and by inheriting from it, you gain several benefits and ensure compatibility with the exception handling mechanisms in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the reasons why we use the `Exception` class while creating a custom exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance and Hierarchy:\n",
    "   By inheriting from the `Exception` class, your custom exception becomes part of the exception hierarchy in Python. This allows your custom exception to inherit the behaviors and attributes of the base `Exception` class, such as the ability to store an error message, access the exception's arguments, and participate in the exception handling mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consistent Exception Handling:\n",
    "   In Python, the exception handling mechanism is based on catching and handling exceptions by their type or class. By deriving your custom exception from the `Exception` class, you ensure that your exception can be caught and handled using standard exception handling techniques like `try-except` blocks, allowing for consistent and predictable error handling across your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compatibility and Interoperability:\n",
    "   By using the `Exception` class as the base class for your custom exception, you make your exception compatible with the existing exception handling infrastructure in Python. This allows your custom exception to be handled alongside other built-in and third-party exceptions in a consistent manner. It ensures that your custom exception can be caught, raised, or handled using the same constructs and mechanisms as other exceptions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code Readability and Maintainability:\n",
    "   By deriving your custom exception from the `Exception` class, you follow established conventions and make your code more readable and maintainable. Other developers familiar with Python will immediately recognize your custom exception as an exception type and understand how to handle it. It also helps in making your codebase more self-explanatory and coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, inheriting from the base `Exception` class provides a solid foundation for creating custom exceptions in Python. It ensures compatibility with the exception handling mechanisms, promotes code readability and maintainability, and allows your custom exception to seamlessly integrate with the existing exception hierarchy in Python.\n",

Then, it checks if the exception class has any base classes (parent classes) by accessing the `__bases__` attribute. If there are base classes, it recursively calls `print_exception_hierarchy()` for each base class, increasing the indentation level by 1.\n",

    "The `ArithmeticError` class in Python is the base class for exceptions that occur during arithmetic operations. It provides a common superclass for arithmetic-related errors, and several specific errors are defined within this class. Two commonly encountered errors in the `ArithmeticError` class are `ZeroDivisionError` and `OverflowError`. Let's explain each of them with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ZeroDivisionError`:\n",
    "   The `ZeroDivisionError` occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero. It indicates an illegal or impossible division operation. It is a subclass of `ArithmeticError`.\n",

    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "       print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   In this example, we attempt to divide the number 10 by zero (`10 / 0`). Since division by zero is not allowed, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised. The code within the `try` block is interrupted, and the program jumps to the `except` block. The `except ZeroDivisionError` block catches the exception and prints the error message, \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `OverflowError`:\n",
    "   The `OverflowError` occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum representable value for a numeric type. It indicates that the calculated result is too large to be represented. It is a subclass of `ArithmeticError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = sys.maxsize + 1\n",
    "       print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "   except OverflowError:\n",
    "       print(\"Error: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, we attempt to add 1 to the maximum representable integer value (`sys.maxsize`) for the current platform. Since the result exceeds the maximum representable value, an `OverflowError` is raised. The `except OverflowError` block catches the exception and prints the error message, \"Error: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `ZeroDivisionError` and `OverflowError` are subclasses of `ArithmeticError` and indicate specific arithmetic-related errors. It is important to handle these exceptions appropriately in your code to prevent unexpected program behavior and provide meaningful error messages to users or developers."

It serves as a superclass for exceptions related to lookup or indexing operations. Two common errors that inherit from the `LookupError` class are `KeyError` and `IndexError`. Let's explain each of them with an example:\n",

The `except KeyError` block catches the exception and prints the error message, \"Error: Key 'city' not found in the dictionary.\"\n",

    "2. `IndexError`:\n",
    "   The `IndexError` occurs when an invalid index is used to access a sequence such as a list or tuple. It is raised when attempting to access an index that is out of range or does not exist in the sequence.\n",
